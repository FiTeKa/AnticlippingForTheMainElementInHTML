# AnticlippingForTheMainElementInHTML

#### What is it doing in short?
This Javascript can help you if your main Element is cutted up by your fixed header and/or footer.

#### What is it doing?
This Javascript ist helping if your header and/or footer in your html are set static to the up/down and your content of your main element ist hiding behind your header and footer and you can't set the margin for the main because the header and footer are setting there height automaticly based of there content.

#### How can I use it in my project?
To use this Javascript file, the easiest way is to put this line of code into your html:
> <script src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiTeKa/AnticlippingForTheMainElementInHTML/main/heightscript.js'></script>
I recommend to put it into the header, but it should work if you're putting it anywhere else in the html file.

Another way to user it, is to download the file with the Javascript you want and put it on your webserver. Next you need to put following line of code into your html anywhere you want. I recomend to put it into the head Element.
> <script src="path/to/the/downloaded/file/heightscript.js"></script>
Please consider changing `path/to/the/downloaded/file/` to the real path.
